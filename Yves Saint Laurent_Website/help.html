                    <summary>Are your products tested on animals?</summary>
                    <p>Our consumers’ health and safety have always been an absolute priority for YSL Beauty. 
                        As is the support of animal welfare. YSL BEAUTY has been committed to new methods of assessing safety that don’t 
                        involve animals.
                    </p>
                    <p>A true pioneer, L'Oréal has been reconstructing human skin models in laboratories to elaborate in vitro safety 
                        tests since 1979, as an alternative to animals. In 1989, L’Oréal completely ceased testing its products on animals, 
                        thus 14 years before the regulation required so. Today, L'Oréal/YSL BEAUTY no longer tests its ingredients on animals 
                        and no longer tolerates any exception to this rule.

                    <summary>Do your products contain silicon?</summary>
                    <p>Silicons are used in some cosmetic products thanks to their unique sensory benefits and properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Long lasting effect in lipstick </li>
                        <li>Give products like creams or makeup a silky, spreadable, luxurious texture. </li>
                        <li>We always choose silicons that are high-performing and with minimal impact on the environment. We don’t use D4*</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To identify them in our products, take a look at the ingredients list on packaging. They can be found under names such as 
                        "dimethicone", "cyclopentasiloxane (D4)", "dimethiconol", "phenyl trimethicone", "amodimethicone", "cyclomethicone". 
                        The easiest way to identify silicons is to look for words that end in one of these: –cone, –conol, –silane or –siloxane.
                    </p>
                    <p>*The silicone called cyclotetrasiloxane (D4) is suspected of having carcinogenic, mutagen or toxic effects for reproduction. 
                        This ingredient is forbidden by the European Regulation.

                    <p>We apologize for discontinuing your favorite YSL Beauty product. Please keep in mind that when a product or shade is 
                        discontinued, it is not done impulsively, but by taking into account many factors. Decisions to discontinue or introduce 
                        a product or size are made in response to consumer preferences and purchasing patterns throughout the country. 
                        Please <a href="contact_us.html">contact us</a> with the name/shade of your favorite product that has been discontinued and we will forward the 
                        information to all appropriate executives.
