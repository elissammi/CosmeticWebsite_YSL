# CosmeticWebsite_YSL
I have wrote a simple blog on this project https://elissammix.medium.com/simple-web-design-for-beginners-using-html-css-f529ea885167
This is a very basic web design based on the famous cosmetic brand Yves Saint Laurent. All sources belongs to rightful owners.

My objective for this project, is to create a simple website which focuses on design consistency & easy-maintenance. I will only use HTML and CSS on this project hence, there is no focus on additional functionality on the webpage.

I am Sammi Chia Li, currently 18 years old in Year 2020, a Foundation student in a University College in Malaysia. 
Note: I am not a professional, been studying computer-related courses for only half a year now.

I am sharing my code with people in hopes that people can give more ideas or get ideas from me.
